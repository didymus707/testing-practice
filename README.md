# Practicing Testing in Javascript with Jest

In this project, unit testing was employed in testing our modules for expected behavior. Jest, a ready to use testrunner was used for the tests. Tests were carried out on methods such as capitalizeString(capitalize first letter of a string), revereseString(as its name implies), Calculator(a factory function that adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides), Ceaser's Cipher(crypting and decrypting by offset of + or - 1), analyseArray(return an object with some properties).
